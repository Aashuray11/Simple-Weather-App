# Simple Weather App

## Project Overview
This is a simple weather application built using React that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any location or country. The app fetches real-time weather data from a remote weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can input the name of a city, state, or country, and the app will provide information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Features
- Search weather by city or country
- Real-time weather updates
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather condition
- Responsive design for optimal use on different devices

## Technologies Used
- React.js for building the user interface
- Axios or Fetch API for making API requests
- OpenWeatherMap API (or any other weather API)
- CSS for styling

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Add your weather API key in the `.env` file or directly in the code
4. Run `npm start` to start the app

## Future Enhancements
- Add additional weather details like wind speed, pressure, and forecast
- Implement a favorites feature to save frequently searched cities
